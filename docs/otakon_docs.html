<h1>CONFIG FILE</h1>
<p>In the config file, the user can specify the image selection mode and<br />
the list of images to select from.</p>
<h2>Defining the selection mode</h2>
<p>Write <code>MODE XXX</code> anywhere in the file (except in the middle of another command),<br />
where <code>XXX</code> can be either of these modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RANDOM</code>  (choose a random image from the list)</li>
<li><code>FIRST</code>   (always choose the first image from the list)</li>
<li><code>ORDER</code>   (choose the image in an increasing order)</li>
<li><code>REVERSE</code> (choose the image in a decreasing order)<br />
Default mode is <code>RANDOM</code>.<br />
NOTE: when this command is written two or more times, only the last command<br />
is taken into consideration, whilst the others are ignored.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Defining the list</h2>
<p>Write</p>
<pre><code>LIST {
aaa
bbb
ccc
...
}
</code></pre>
<p>anywhere in the file (except in the middle of another command), where<br />
<code>aaa</code>, <code>bbb</code>, <code>ccc</code> are the names of the image files to be put into the list<br />
(.png extension is excluded as it's the only file format currently supported),<br />
and <code>...</code> means that any amount of names can be specified before the curly<br />
brackets are closed, marking the end of the list.<br />
NOTE: filenames must not include spaces, as spaces and commas (<code>,</code>) are<br />
considered a way to separate filenames.<br />
Failing to define a list causes an error, and the program to fallsback to a<br />
default texture.<br />
NOTE: when two or more lists are defined, only the one defined last is<br />
taken into consideration, whilst the others are ignored.</p>
<h2>Setting alpha color</h2>
<p>The alpha (background) color can be set by using the <code>ALPHA</code> command, followed<br />
by the three colors in the order: red, green, blue. Every color must be in<br />
range 0 to 255 (both included).<br />
For example:</p>
<pre><code>ALPHA 255,128,0
</code></pre>
<h2>Setting an edge</h2>
<p>It's possible to set an edge (that will be filled with the alpha color) by<br />
writing the <code>EDGE</code> command, followed by a number in range 0 to 99 (both<br />
included).<br />
For example:</p>
<pre><code>EDGE 2
</code></pre>
<h2>Preventing Otakon from running</h2>
<p>The user can prevent the program from printing anything by writing the <code>KILL</code><br />
command anywhere in the program (except in the middle of another command).</p>
<h2>Additional notes</h2>
<p>Please note that commands must be separated from one another with at least<br />
one space or newline character.<br />
For example<br />
<code>KILLMODE REVERSE</code><br />
is invalid, but<br />
<code>KILL MODE REVERSE</code> and</p>
<pre><code>KILL
MODE REVERSE
</code></pre>
<p>are valid.</p>
