Can be configured to choose from a list of images in a random order,
and can be easily switched on and off from terminal (for use on
terminals supporting truecolor).

## DOCUMENTATION
Documentation can be found inside ```docs/otakon_docs.md```.

## COMPILING
To compile everything, use
```make all```
in the clone directory.\
To compile just the docs, use
```make docs```
in the clone directory.\
To compile just the executable, use
```make otakon```
in the clone directory.

## TODO
- Move the configuration and executable files in the
  standard directories for Linux.
